								<h2>Program Overview</h2>
								<p>Our faculty is made up of some of the worldâ€™s finest minds. They are senior scholar-practitioners who excel in academia as well as their professions and practices. Many have taught at other leading universities and have been published widely. At the same time, our faculty represent a unique diversity of disciplines, ethnicity, cultures, professions, and academic interests. That's important, because at Fielding, you are in the driver's seat.</p>

								<p>Matching your research to your career goals is a major part of what we do. We believe that you have  many valuable things to contribute to your learning process, so what we try to accomplish in our programs is to define that sweet spot, that unique intersection between your professional expertise and academic interests, and the unique theoretical knowledge of our professors. We are dedicated to finding that intersection and nurturing your doctoral competency to make it a reality.</p>
