								<p>Matching your research to your career goals is a major part of what we do. We believe that you have  many valuable things to contribute to your learning process, so what we try to accomplish in our programs is to define that sweet spot, that unique intersection between your professional expertise and academic interests, and the unique theoretical knowledge of our professors. We are dedicated to finding that intersection and nurturing your doctoral competency to make it a reality.</p>
